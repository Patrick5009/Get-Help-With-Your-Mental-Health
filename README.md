Get Help For Your Mental Health

This is a website that was built in 2 days while visiting 8 West Consulting in Cork. 

This project is intended to provide people with mental health issues a place they can

go to search for helplines and support sites, get tips on how to have a healthy frame

of mind, read inspirational quotes to get them motivated, watch embeded videos about

how other people have dealt with mental health issues and also to check out informational

graphs about mental health in general. 


Due to the time limits the charts and videos were not impletmented. To get a minimal viable 

product complete, the home page with motivational quotes and mental health tips were 

completed first, followed after by links to helplines and support sites for anyone dealing 

with mental health issues and looking for help.


I have yet to figure out how to upload images here for proof of all my scoping work, my user stories

and also my Mark Up Validation results and my CSS Validation results. My google Lighthouse performance

is also with this documentation. Desktop was all in the 90's, mobile was all 90's bar one that was 85.


I used stock photography from https://www.pexels.com/ for the main background and hero image.

I used Bootstrap 4.6 for the main navigation bar and for parts of the responsiveness.
